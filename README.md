# Sword Fighting Game

## Premise

This Video Game idea was to have an online multiplayer 1v1 scenario sword combat, in which you want to predict your oponents next move to either parry or counterattack, and manage to sever his torso or head. Rather than having your mouse movement dictate your camera angle, this game's mouse movement acts as your sword movement. 

### Camera and Movement
- Having the Camera always face the oponent, move around the oponent, dash to give yourself a new approach angle (short delay for opponent camera refocus), move towards and away from them, crouch and jump over them. 

### Sword

- #### Attacking

For attacking the opponent, there several different slash angles you can perform. For example, pressing your mouse button down at the top left of the screen and releasing it at the bottom right will slash diagonaly in a (1,-1) directionaly vector. A variety of combos

- #### Guarding

In the same logic, you can also guard an incomming attack by right cliking using the same logic mentionned above, and parying perpendicularly 

- #### Damage

As visible in the gif below, every body part of a player's body has an glowing indicator. Depending on the number of hits received on a region, the body part will glow in a different color. Once a critical level is reached, the player may either no longer use certain attacks or become slow on certain movements. Once the players torso or head reach critical levels, they can be severed and the opponent takes the victory.

- #### Combos

Certain sequence of movements will allow the player to perform special attacks which can break through shielding and/or deal severe damage. Although, these attacks come at a cost and if not used wisely, can leave you wide open.

- #### Other ideas
  -Cosmetics 
  -Different character pool, ie. tanks, assassins, knights. Each with their own benefits/drawbacks

# Models
This project was my first experience with 3D modeling. High res models like these were quite the task for getting started, so I switched to lower poly models in order to get used to rigging and animating. They are currently way too clunky, but I will get there eventually!
